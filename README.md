# LM Profile Switcher

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Independent, local-first companion for [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai): hardware-aware model profiles, task-based configuration recommendations, bounded benchmarking, and safe one-click switching. It is an **independent, unofficial community project** — not affiliated with or endorsed by LM Studio.

## Features

- **Schema-validated profiles** — versioned `HardwareProfile` / `ModelProfile` / `TaskProfile` / `RuntimeProfile` / `GenerationProfile` / `BehaviorProfile` contracts, persisted as plain JSON/YAML under `LMPS_HOME` (default `~/.lmps`) with atomic writes and write-ahead backups.
- **Hardware-aware recommendations** — local hardware probe (GPU via `nvidia-smi`, generic fallback), deterministic candidate optimizer with a VRAM safety margin, ranked per task kind with bilingual rationale.
- **Benchmark Lite** — bounded, cancellable, fingerprint-bound objective benchmarks (load time, TTFT, prefill, decode tokens/s, peak VRAM) that cleanly restore the previous model afterwards.
- **Safe activation transaction** — an orchestrated state machine with health check and automatic rollback; one shared `activation.lock` serializes the CLI, tray, Benchmark, hook, and proxy activation paths.
- **Desktop app (Tauri 2)** — a React/Web GUI hosted by a thin Rust shell: profile editor, optimization wizard, benchmark view, hardware panel, and a system tray that drives the same activation transaction as the CLI.
- **Local automation (loopback only)** —
  - `lmps hook`: app/task-driven model switching with persistent token auth and deny-by-default rules;
  - `lmps proxy`: an OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface (`GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`) mapping virtual model names to profiles via a deny-by-default alias document, with per-session locking and explicit opt-in activation. Both bind to `127.0.0.1` only.
- **i18n** — `zh-CN` and `en` for every user-visible string; `--json` output uses a stable, never-localized machine envelope.
- **Governed distribution** — structural policy scan and secret scan (`policy:scan`) gate every commit, release staging, and the CI pipeline (strict mode).

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20 and pnpm 10.15.0 (Corepack supported).
- Windows or macOS for the desktop build; the CLI runs anywhere Node.js runs.

## Getting started

```text
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm run build
corepack pnpm run lmps -- --help
corepack pnpm run lmps -- --json profile list
```

`corepack pnpm run check` runs lint, typecheck, the i18n gate, the TypeScript build, domain-schema generation + freshness, unit tests, and the compliance bundle. It needs no LM Studio connection or model download.
